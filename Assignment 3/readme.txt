AlphaBeta player was obviously faster than the Minimax player.
I did some tests and the results are as follows:

Time taken (average) for the first move:
Minimax    - 2 seconds
alphaBeta  - 0.8 seconds
Difference - 60%

Time taken (average) for the second move:
Minimax    - 0.12 seconds
alphaBeta  - 0.025
Difference - 79%

Time taken for 20 continous games:
Minimax    - 52 seconds
alphaBeta  - 5 seconds
Difference - 90.3%

The resutls also show that alphabeta is faster.
And it gets exponentially better than Minimax for bigger computations.
